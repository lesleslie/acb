"""Performance benchmarks for ACB adapters.

These benchmarks measure:
- Individual operation performance (set, get, delete)
- Serialization performance
- Concurrency characteristics
- Throughput (operations per second)
- Memory usage patterns

Benchmarks use pytest-benchmark for consistent measurement across runs.
