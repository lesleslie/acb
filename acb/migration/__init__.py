"""ACB Migration and Compatibility Tools.

This module provides tools for migrating existing ACB installations to new
architectures and maintaining backward compatibility.

Key Components:
    - Migration assessment and version detection
    - Automated configuration migration
    - Compatibility layers for deprecated interfaces
    - Rollback mechanisms
    - Migration testing and validation

Usage:
    from acb.migration import MigrationManager, assess_migration

    # Assess current installation
    assessment = await assess_migration()

    # Perform migration
    manager = MigrationManager()
    result = await manager.migrate(target_version="0.20.0")
