# Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Context**: Removed all references to deleted features from ACB documentation (v0.19.1+)

## Deleted Features Removed from Documentation

The following features were deleted from ACB in v0.19.1+ and all documentation references have been removed:

1. **Feature Store Adapters** (`acb/adapters/feature_store/`)
1. **ML Model Adapters** (`acb/adapters/mlmodel/`)
1. **NLP Adapters** (`acb/adapters/nlp/`)
1. **Experiment Tracking Adapters** (`acb/adapters/experiment/`)
1. **Gateway System** (`acb/gateway/` + `acb/adapters/gateway/`)
1. **Transformers System** (`acb/transformers/`)

## Files Updated

### 1. FEATURE_DELETION_SUMMARY.md

- Added replacement guidance for each deleted feature
- Documented ACB's focused mission post-deletion

### 2. ACB_UNIFIED_PLAN.md

**Status**: Extensively updated
**Changes**:

- Updated phase completion counts:
  - Phase 5: Changed from 7/7 to 2/2 (removed ML Model, Decision/Reasoning, Feature Store, Experiment Tracking, NLP)
  - Phase 6: Changed from 2/3 to 1/2 (removed API Gateway, Workflow Management, Data Transformation)
- Removed detailed implementation sections for adapters 15-19
- Updated Phase 5 Achievement Summary to note only Unified AI and Embedding adapters remain
- Removed API Gateway Components section
- Removed Workflow Management Service section
- Removed Data Transformation Service section
- Updated "Detailed Feature Descriptions" to remove deleted features
- Added "Removed Features (v0.19.1+)" section
- Updated UV Optional Dependency Groups (removed: gateway, ml, feature, experiment, decision, nlp, ai_full)
- Removed detailed feature descriptions for deleted adapters
- Updated success metrics to remove API Gateway metrics

### 3. IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md

**Status**: Extensively updated
**Changes**:

- Marked API Gateway Components as [DELETED] with migration guidance
- Marked Workflow Management Service as [DELETED]
- Marked Data Transformation Service as [DELETED]
- Removed gateway-related action items from Phase 3 completion
- Updated "Recommended Implementation Order" section:
  - Removed "Fix Gateway Test Infrastructure" action item
  - Removed "Complete Gateway Verification" action item
  - Removed "Begin Phase 6a: Workflow Management" action item
  - Removed "Implement Data Transformation Service" action item
  - Renumbered remaining items
- Updated "Risk Assessment" section:
  - Removed "Gateway Test Failures" risk
  - Removed "Workflow/Transformation Integration" risk
  - Updated remaining risks
- Updated "Success Criteria Summary":
  - Simplified Phase 3 completion criteria (removed gateway-specific criteria)
  - Simplified Phase 6 completion criteria (removed workflow and transformation criteria)
- Updated "Next Steps" section:
  - Removed gateway, workflow, and transformation action items
  - Updated timeline estimate from 4-5 months to 3-4 months

### 4. AGENTS.md

**Status**: Minor update
**Changes**:

- Removed `gateway/` from project structure description
- Updated: "`acb/` holds production code; `actions/`, `adapters/`, `core/`, and `services/` supply reusable primitives"

### 5. PHASE_2_TYPE_ERROR_FIXES.md

**Status**: Updated with historical notes
**Changes**:

- Added note that `acb/adapters/feature_store/` was deleted in v0.19.1+
- Added note that several medium-priority files were deleted (experiment, nlp, gateway, mlmodel, feature_store)
- Removed deleted files from medium priority list
- Updated "Next Steps" section with note about deleted adapters
- Simplified remaining work categories

### 6. REFURB_MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md

**Status**: Updated with historical note
**Changes**:

- Added note at top explaining that file list is historical
- Clarified that experiment, feature_store, mlmodel, nlp, gateway adapters were deleted in v0.19.1+

## Files Checked (No Changes Required)

The following files were checked but did not contain references to deleted features:

- `README.md` - No references found
- `CLAUDE.md` - No references found
- `docs/ADAPTER_TEMPLATE.md` - Only "experimental" status mentioned (not a feature reference)
- `docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` - No references found
- `docs/MIGRATION-0.19.0.md` - No references found
- `docs/CORE_SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - No references found
- `GEMINI.md` - No references found
- `PHASE_0_FINDINGS.md` - No references found
- `PHASE_0_LFM_VALIDATION_PLAN.md` - No references found
- `PHASE_0_LFM2_USAGE.md` - No references found
- `PHASE_0_STATUS.md` - No references found

## Search Commands Used

```bash
# Find all markdown files with references to deleted features
rg -i "feature_store|mlmodel|experiment|nlp|gateway|transformers" --type md

# Check specific documentation files
rg -i "gateway|mlmodel|feature_store|experiment tracking|nlp adapter|transformers system" \
  AGENTS.md GEMINI.md PHASE_0_*.md PHASE_2_TYPE_ERROR_FIXES.md --context 1

# Verify migration guides and architecture docs
rg -i "gateway|mlmodel|feature_store|experiment tracking|nlp adapter|transformers system" \
  docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md docs/MIGRATION-0.19.0.md docs/CORE_SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE.md --context 1
```

## Impact Summary

### Documentation Now Reflects:

1. **Focused Mission**: ACB's simplified architecture focusing on core adapter functionality
1. **Accurate Phase Status**: Correct completion counts (Phase 5: 2/2, Phase 6: 1/2)
1. **Clear Migration Guidance**: Users know which external tools to use instead
1. **Realistic Timelines**: Updated from 4-5 months to 3-4 months for remaining work
1. **Clean References**: No orphaned references to deleted features

### Key Improvements:

- All major planning documents updated (ACB_UNIFIED_PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)
- Historical documents marked with context notes (PHASE_2_TYPE_ERROR_FIXES.md, REFURB_MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md)
- Created comprehensive deletion summary (FEATURE_DELETION_SUMMARY.md)
- Simplified risk assessments and action items
- Updated dependency groups and feature lists

## Verification

To verify all references have been removed:

```bash
# Check for any remaining references to deleted features
rg -i "feature_store|mlmodel adapter|experiment tracking|nlp adapter|gateway system|transformers system" \
  --type md \
  --glob "!FEATURE_DELETION_SUMMARY.md" \
  --glob "!DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md" \
  --glob "!PHASE_2_TYPE_ERROR_FIXES.md" \
  --glob "!REFURB_MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md"
```

## Next Steps

Documentation is now clean and consistent. Future updates should:

1. Reference FEATURE_DELETION_SUMMARY.md for migration guidance
1. Update any new documentation to exclude deleted features
1. Maintain focus on ACB's core adapter functionality
1. Direct users to external solutions for complex enterprise features
