# Queue Adapter Unification - Remaining Work

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** Phase 4 EventPublisher Tests Complete, Additional Work Required

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed (Phases 1-4)

1. **Phase 1**: Queue adapter foundation created (`acb/adapters/queue/_base.py`)
1. **Phase 2**: Memory adapter implementation (`acb/adapters/queue/memory.py`)
1. **Phase 3**: Events layer refactored to use queue adapter
   - `acb/events/publisher.py` refactored
   - `acb/events/subscriber.py` updated
   - Removed `EventQueue` and `PublisherBackend` classes
1. **Phase 4**: EventPublisher tests fully working
   - **25/25 tests passing (100%)** in `test_publisher.py`
   - Fixed race condition with worker subscription timing
   - All integration tests for EventPublisher working

### ❌ Remaining Work

Test run results show **70 failed, 72 passed, 8 errors** in the events system:

#### 1. EventSubscriber System (High Priority)

**File:** `tests/events/test_subscriber.py`
**Status:** Most tests failing or erroring

**Issues:**

- EventSubscriber needs queue adapter integration
- Tests expect old backend-based architecture
- Subscription management needs updating
- Event routing and filtering may need adjustments

**Tests Failing:**

- `TestSubscriberSettings` (4 tests)
- `TestEventBuffer` (6 tests)
- `TestEventFilter` (4 tests)
- `TestEventRouter` (4 tests)
- `TestManagedSubscription` (4 tests)
- `TestEventSubscriber` (15 tests, 8 errors)
- `TestEventSubscriberFactory` (3 tests)
- `TestEventSubscriberIntegration` (4 tests)

**Estimated Work:** 4-6 hours

#### 2. Event Discovery System (Medium Priority)

**File:** `tests/events/test_discovery.py`
**Status:** Multiple test failures

**Issues:**

- Discovery tests may reference removed backend enums
- Event metadata and capabilities need verification
- Handler registry tests may need updates

**Tests Failing:**

- `TestEventCapability` (1 test)
- `TestEventMetadata` (3 tests)
- `TestEventMetadataTemplate` (2 tests)
- `TestEventHandlerRegistry` (1 test)
- `TestEventHandlerInfo` (1 test)
- `TestEventHandlerOverrides` (3 tests)
- `TestEventHandlerSettings` (3 tests)

**Estimated Work:** 2-3 hours

#### 3. Integration Tests (Medium Priority)

**File:** `tests/events/test_integration.py`
**Status:** All integration tests failing

**Issues:**

- End-to-end tests need queue adapter mocking
- EventsService integration needs updating
- Handler decorators may need adjustments

**Tests Failing:**

- `TestEndToEndEventFlow` (4 tests)
- `TestEventsServiceIntegration` (4 tests)
- `TestEventHandlerDecorators` (4 tests)
- `TestDiscoveryIntegration` (1 test)
- `TestPerformanceAndScalability` (3 tests)

**Estimated Work:** 3-4 hours

#### 4. Events Base Tests (Low Priority)

**File:** `tests/events/test_events_base.py`
**Status:** All tests failing

**Tests Failing:** All tests related to base event functionality

**Estimated Work:** 1-2 hours

## Root Causes Analysis

### 1. EventSubscriber Not Fully Migrated

The EventSubscriber implementation in `acb/events/subscriber.py` may not be fully updated to use the queue adapter. Review needed:

- Does it use `import_adapter("queue")`?
- Does it leverage the queue adapter's `subscribe()` method?
- Are there remnants of old backend logic?

### 2. Test Fixtures Missing Queue Adapter Mocking

Many tests don't have the `mock_queue_adapter_import` fixture that was created for EventPublisher tests. This fixture needs to be:

- Shared across all event tests (moved to `tests/events/conftest.py` if not already there)
- Applied to all test classes/functions that create event system components

### 3. Deprecated Imports Still Present

Tests may still be trying to import removed classes:

- `EventQueue` (removed)
- `PublisherBackend` (removed)
- Old backend-specific interfaces

### 4. Settings Field Names Changed

EventPublisher settings were updated in Phase 3:

- `backend` → `event_topic_prefix`
- `enable_health_checks` → `health_check_enabled`
- `enable_dead_letter_queue` → `dead_letter_queue`

EventSubscriber tests may still use old field names.

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 5: Complete EventSubscriber Migration (Priority 1)

**Goal:** Get all EventSubscriber tests passing

**Steps:**

1. Review `acb/events/subscriber.py` implementation

   - Verify queue adapter integration is complete
   - Ensure it uses unified queue backend
   - Check for any remaining old backend code

1. Update EventSubscriber tests (`tests/events/test_subscriber.py`)

   - Add `mock_queue_adapter_import` fixture to all tests
   - Remove deprecated imports
   - Update settings field names
   - Fix subscription management tests
   - Fix event routing/filtering tests

1. Run and fix tests incrementally

   - Fix basic tests first (settings, creation)
   - Then lifecycle tests
   - Then integration tests
   - Finally performance/scalability tests

**Success Criteria:** All 44 EventSubscriber tests passing

### Phase 6: Fix Event Discovery Tests (Priority 2)

**Goal:** Get all discovery tests passing

**Steps:**

1. Review discovery system for deprecated references
1. Update event metadata tests
1. Fix handler registry tests
1. Fix handler override tests
1. Update settings loading tests

**Success Criteria:** All discovery tests passing

### Phase 7: Fix Integration Tests (Priority 3)

**Goal:** Get end-to-end integration tests working

**Steps:**

1. Update EventsService integration
1. Fix end-to-end event flow tests
1. Update handler decorator tests
1. Fix performance/scalability tests

**Success Criteria:** All integration tests passing

### Phase 8: Complete Events Base Tests (Priority 4)

**Goal:** Get all base event tests passing

**Steps:**

1. Review and fix base event functionality tests
1. Ensure consistency with new architecture

**Success Criteria:** All events base tests passing

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 5** (EventSubscriber): 4-6 hours
- **Phase 6** (Discovery): 2-3 hours
- **Phase 7** (Integration): 3-4 hours
- **Phase 8** (Base Tests): 1-2 hours

**Total:** 10-15 hours additional work

## Success Metrics

### Current

- ✅ EventPublisher tests: 25/25 passing (100%)
- ❌ Full events system: 72/150 passing (48%)

### Target

- ✅ EventPublisher tests: 25/25 passing (100%)
- ✅ EventSubscriber tests: 44/44 passing (100%)
- ✅ Event discovery tests: 38/38 passing (100%)
- ✅ Integration tests: 16/16 passing (100%)
- ✅ Base tests: All passing
- ✅ **Full events system: 150/150 passing (100%)**

## Notes

The Phase 4 completion for EventPublisher was a significant achievement, demonstrating that the queue adapter architecture works correctly. The remaining work is primarily:

1. **Applying the same patterns** to EventSubscriber and other components
1. **Updating test fixtures** to use queue adapter mocking
1. **Removing deprecated imports** and updating field names

The foundation is solid - we just need to complete the migration across the entire events system.
