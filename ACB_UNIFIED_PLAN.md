## UV Optional Dependency Groups

Each adapter category will have its own uv optional dependency group in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
# Core Infrastructure
services = []  # Built into core
health = []    # Built into core
performance = [] # Built into core
logging = []   # Built into core (loguru)


# AI/ML Foundation
llm = ["openai>=1.0.0", "anthropic>=0.5.0", "ollama>=0.1.0"]
embedding = ["sentence-transformers>=2.0.0", "transformers>=4.0.0"]
ml = ["tensorflow-serving-api>=2.0.0", "torchserve>=0.8.0"]
feature = ["feast>=0.35.0", "tecton>=0.10.0"]
experiment = ["mlflow>=2.0.0", "wandb>=0.15.0"]
decision = ["langchain>=0.1.0", "llama-index>=0.8.0"]
nlp = ["spacy>=3.0.0", "nltk>=3.8.0"]

# Data Infrastructure
graph = ["neo4j>=5.0.0", "py2neo>=2021.0.0"]

# Integration & Orchestration
mcp = ["fastmcp>=2.0.0", "uvicorn>=0.20.0"]

# Meta-groups for convenience
qa = ["acb[lint,format,type,security,test,refactor]"]
ai = ["acb[llm,embedding,ml,feature,experiment,decision,nlp]"]
dev = ["acb[qa,ai,graph,mcp]"]
```

This structure ensures that users can install only the components they need while maintaining granular control over dependencies. Each adapter category has its own optional dependency group, and meta-groups provide convenient bundles for common use cases.
