# ACB Unified Implementation Plan

This document outlines a prioritized and unified implementation plan for key ACB features, organized to ensure proper dependencies and architectural coherence. This plan is a consolidation of `ACB_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and `ACB_IMPLEMENTATION_ORDER.md`.

**Timeline**: 26 months (extended from 24 months to accommodate essential components)

**Overall Progress: 5 of 6 Phases Complete (83% Complete)**

- ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-4) - **COMPLETED (6/6)**
- ✅ Phase 2: Infrastructure & Optimization (Months 5-8) - **COMPLETED (3/3)**
- ✅ Phase 3: Core Systems Enhancement (Months 9-12) - **COMPLETED (3/3)**
- ✅ Phase 4: Data Infrastructure (Months 13-16) - **COMPLETED (2/2)**
- ✅ Phase 5: AI/ML Foundation (Months 17-22) - **COMPLETED (7/7)**
- 🟡 Phase 6: Integration & Orchestration (Months 23-26) - **PARTIALLY COMPLETE (2/3)**

**🚀 URGENT: FastBlocks Performance Optimization Integration Required**

**Date**: September 29, 2025
**Trigger**: FastBlocks development paused due to ACB adapter pattern violations
**Priority**: **CRITICAL - Phase 1 Acceleration Required**

### FastBlocks Integration Requirements:

FastBlocks has **production-ready performance optimization code** that needs proper integration:

**Components to Integrate**:

1. **PerformanceOptimizer**: Template rendering metrics and optimization recommendations
1. **Multi-tier Caching**: HOT/WARM/COLD/FROZEN tier system with intelligent promotion
1. **QueryPerformanceOptimizer**: SQL anti-pattern detection and query analysis
1. **AsyncPerformanceOptimizer**: Task prioritization and resource pooling

**Current Problem**:

- Performance optimizers incorrectly placed in FastBlocks adapters (`database/`, `asyncops/`)
- 14 template utility files violate ACB naming conventions (need `_` prefix)
- Code is stable (17/23 tests passing, excellent benchmarks) but architecturally misplaced

**Integration Strategy**:

- Move performance optimizers to ACB Services Layer during Phase 1 implementation
- Create `acb/services/performance/` directory structure
- Maintain FastBlocks compatibility during migration
- Use performance optimization as **Services Layer validation case**

This represents an excellent opportunity to **validate Services Layer design** with real, production-tested code.
