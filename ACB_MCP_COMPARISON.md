```python
# Stream large resources efficiently
async def get_event_stream() -> AsyncGenerator[Dict[str, Any], None]:
    """Get a stream of system events through MCP."""
    try:
        counter = 0
        while True:
            yield {
                "event_id": counter,
                "timestamp": asyncio.get_event_loop().time(),
                "type": "heartbeat",
                "data": {"counter": counter}
            }
            counter += 1
            await asyncio.sleep(10)  # Send heartbeat every 10 seconds
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        pass
```
